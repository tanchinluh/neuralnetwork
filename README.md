# Scilab Neural Network Module

Scilab Neural Network Module is a simple, pure Scilab implementation of neural network in matrix form. The algorithms are based on book "Neural Network Design" book by Martin T. Hagan. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

1. This module is purely written in Scilab and hence does not require any external libraries. However, it works well with other Scilab module such as IPCV (https://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/IPCV/4.1). 


### Installing

The module could be easily install from the Scilab atoms portal by using command:

--> atomsInstall('neuralnetwork'); 

or the offline version by replacing the input argument to the zip file name.

If you prefer to build then module, download the source and unzip it, just type in scilab:

```
--> exec("neuralnetwork_Path/builder.sce")
```

If the module is place in the "contrib" folder, it could be loaded from the "Toolboxes" menu. Otherwise, just type in scilab:

``` 
--> exec("neuralnetwork_path/loader.sce"); 
```

neuralnetwork_Path is where this file is.

### EXAMPLES and DEMOS
 To see some examples, use the help function from Scilab console and run the examples from the help page.


## Features
The module could be used to build following netwroks
1. Perceptron
2. Adaline
3. Multilayer Feedforware Backpropagation Network
   - Gradient Decent
